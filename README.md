CPP-XBMC-API
============

A simple XBMC remote using the JSON RPC API.

This was built in NetBeans IDE 7.3 so it may be easier if you import this project into a working NetBeans installation and then compile.
The project is meant to be a hobby project for myself, so I will not be providing any documentation with it.

I found it difficult to find any information on how utilize the XBMC API using c++ so feel free to use my code as a base for your own project.
